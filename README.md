# Multifacial Skin Detection and Analysis Python Script

This Python script focuses on detecting multiple faces in an image using Haar cascades and performing skin detection and analysis using RGB thresholding. It utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing and manipulation.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required libraries installed before running the script:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy (numpy)
Matplotlib (matplotlib)

# Description

The script reads an image and applies face detection using Haar cascades to identify multiple faces.
After face detection, it performs skin detection using an RGB thresholding approach.
The results of skin detection are displayed using the cv2_imshow function from the OpenCV library.
Additional processing steps, such as median blurring, are applied to enhance the skin detection results.
The script provides visual insights into the detected faces and the corresponding skin regions.
